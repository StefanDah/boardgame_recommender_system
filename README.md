# Boardgame recommendation system using TensorFlow Recommenders
This project implements a recommendation system using TensorFlow and is part of [The-Recommend-DICE-er](https://github.com/ProgrammerNameHere/The-Recommen-DICE-er)
boardgame recommendation system.

Currently this recommendation system supports the retrieval of a list of boardgame recommendations based on features of a game from a user input taken from a list of roughly 30.000 boardgames (content-based filtering).

### To-Do
* Increase number of boardgame features for model training
* Build a user tower to include user ratings (collaborative-based-filtering)
* Combine user tower and candidate tower to build a hybrid system
